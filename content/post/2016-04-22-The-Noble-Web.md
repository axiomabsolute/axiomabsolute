Outline
1. State of the web today
    a. Mostly pages
    b. Good news, web is being used heavily
    c. Bad news, many aspects of why the web was created have been de-emphasized
    d. Bad news, heavy use makes it hard to fix problems
2. The Noble Web
    a. Web was originally designed with values in mind to encourage growth and usefulness
    b. Many of these design values have received less attention as usage of the WWW exploded
    c. That's sad
3. Goals of the noble web
    a. Separate content from presentation
        * Templates, HTML, and CSS
        * Makes content easier to maintain
        * Makes it possible to adapt content to multiple forms of presentation
            - Not just screen readers, but different device formats, devices with different capabilities, as well as multiple media formats
    b. User has control over how content is consumed
        * Most users accept the style sheet served up with the content, but users are always in control
        * Every style can be overridden, every line of JavaScript can be inspected and changed
        * On the one hand, this undermines the person who designed the webpage.  On the other, it allows users to make up for poorly designed webpages
        * Also allows in-browser, client driven customization
        * StyleBot
    c. Graceful degredation
        * If a consumer's device does not support a feature used in the page, the page does not crash (for HTML and CSS).  The content will be available for modification.
    d. Content consumers as content producers
        * Web-based content production tools
        * Blogs, YouTube, Facebook, Pintrest, Reddit, forums, email
        * Not just produce content, but share it and make it accessible
    e. Everything is uniquely addressed and connected, allowing users to explore the web
        * URLs are a big deal
        * Without this, the web falls apart
