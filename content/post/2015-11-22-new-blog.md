I'm making a second attempt at getting this blog up and running.

I had recurring issues with running Jekyll on windows; setting up Ruby, compiling modules from source, struggling with missing Visual C++ compilers.  I needed something easier.

After playing around with [Harp](http://harpjs.com/) (not quite flexible enough), [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) (too much overhead from Node.js on windows), and a few others, I settled on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
